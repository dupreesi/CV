# CV

## Introducing: Simon Dupr√©e

I am a full stack JavaScript Developer based in London. I am currently developing applications for social impact projects working closely together with developers from Gaza and London within the Founders and Coders community (Tech for Better programme). Software development requires a high level of patience whilst dealing with time pressures. Team work and effective communication are essential skills in staying productive within a workflow based on continuous integration. My study background and professional experiences provided me with tools to master high levels of analytical thinking and communication.
